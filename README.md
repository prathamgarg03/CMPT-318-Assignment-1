## Tasks

### Task 1: Anomaly Detection

**Goal**: Apply statistical methods to detect point anomalies in the dataset.

- Handle missing data using linear interpolation.
- Identify anomalies using Z-scores.
- Calculate the percentage of data points considered as anomalies.

### Task 2: Correlation Analysis

**Goal**: Compute the correlation for each disjoint pair of the responses using Pearsonâ€™s sample correlation coefficient.

- Create a correlation matrix.
- Visualize the correlation matrix using color-coding.

### Task 3: Time Window Analysis

**Goal**: Analyze power consumption patterns in specific time windows.

- Determine representative time windows for day and night hours.
- Compute average Global_intensity values for these time windows over weekdays and weekends.
- Perform linear and polynomial regression for the time windows and visualize the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this assignment is the Household Electricity Consumption Dataset, which represents a multivariate time series describing power consumption behavior over time with one datapoint per minute. The time-dependent variables are:

- Global_active_power
- Global_reactive_power
- Voltage
- Global_intensity
- Submetering 1
- Submetering 2
- Submetering 3

## Results

The results of the analysis include:
1. Anomalies detected and their percentage.
2. Correlation matrix and its visualization.
3. Regression analysis and graphical representation of power consumption patterns.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prathamgarg03/CMPT-318-Assignment-1.git
    cd CMPT-318-Assignment-1
    ```
2. Open the R script files in your preferred R environment (e.g., RStudio).
3. Execute the scripts to perform the analysis and generate the results.
